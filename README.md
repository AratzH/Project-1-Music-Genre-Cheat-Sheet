## Project Motivation\
\
Music Producers often needs to define the track genre, tempo and key as first step when starting a new project. \
\
This analysis offers an alternate to get that information based in historical data collected from Spotify.\
\
\
## File Descriptions\
\
Project 1 - Music Genre Cheat Sheet.ipynb :  Analysis documentation and reproducible code.\
songDb.csv -  Spotify track historical data with required features.\
\
## Project insights\
The result of the analysis is a four-blocker able to represent the main tempo, key's and the most similar genres to the one of interest.\
\
Feature engineering for Main parameters was required. Tempo switched to integer value, Genre standardized to particular main genres and Key improved by adding the mode and textual definition.\
\
Genre similarity metrics based in percentage of shared features needed to be created to display the closest genres list.\
\
All relevant data findings and current version limitations accessible via a dedicated medium post: [The Music Genre Cheat Sheet.](https://medium.com/the-music-genre-cheat-sheet/the-music-genre-cheat-sheet-fb57abf74301)\
